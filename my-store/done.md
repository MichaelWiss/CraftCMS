# Done

- Rebranded frontend copy from Diana's Seafood to Hubert's Seafood across landing, listings, and footer email.
- Added reusable layout shell (`PageShell`) and form primitives (`FormField`, `FormSection`, `TextInput`) to unify page scaffolding and form styling.
- Created product detail hook with slug endpoint support and optimistic cart store enhancements with derived metrics.
